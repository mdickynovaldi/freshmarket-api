## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed
- [Docker](https://docker.com) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

### Database Setup

Setup database:

```sh
# Run database only
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d

# Run all services
docker compose up
```

Migrate database:

```sh
bun db:migrate:dev
```

Seed initial products:

```sh
bun db:seed
```

To run:

```sh
bun dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>

## Prisma Setup

You already have a .gitignore file. Don't forget to add `.env` in it to not commit any private information.

Next steps:

1. Set the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file to point to your existing database. If your database has no tables yet, read <https://pris.ly/d/getting-started>
2. Set the provider of the datasource block in schema.prisma to match your database: postgresql, mysql, sqlite, sqlserver, mongodb or cockroachdb.
3. Run prisma db pull to turn your database schema into a Prisma schema.
4. Run prisma generate to generate the Prisma Client. You can then start querying your database.
